Modern day mathematics can be broadly classified into 4 categories:

1. Pure Mathematics
2. Applied Mathematics
3. Combinatorial / Recreational Mathematics
4. Statistics

The pure mathematics is the branch of mathematics which included multiple subjects like Topology, Number theory, Geometry, Algebra, Analysis.

I am particularly interested in Algebra and Geometry. I have till now studied Topology, Number theory, Algebra including Group Theory, Ring Theory, Field theory.
